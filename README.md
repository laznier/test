# My PM Solutions Prototype

This is a simple multi-page site demonstrating project management tools.  
Currently includes:

- **Network Diagram & Critical Path Tool** (in the `network-diagram/` folder).
- **WBS Generator** (in the `WSB-generator/` folder).
- **Earned Value Calculator** (in the `evc/` folder).
- **Risk Register & Assessment** (in the `risk-register/` folder).
- **Probability & Simulations** (in the `monte-carlo/` folder).
- Future PM Tool (placeholder).

## Local Development

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the landing page.
3. Each tool resides in its own folder (e.g., `network-diagram/index.html` for the Network Diagram Tool).
4. Optionally, you can host it locally (e.g., via a simple HTTP server) if needed.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Push all files to a **public GitHub repository**.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Pages** (on the right sidebar in GitHub).
3. Under "Branch," select `main` (or `master`) and then `/ (root)` folder. Click **Save**.
4. Wait a few seconds; GitHub will give you a URL like `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
5. Open that URL in your browser. You should see the landing page.

## Roadmap

- Continue adding more PM tools (e.g., Gantt Chart, Risk Matrix, etc.).
- Consider a backend (Node.js, etc.) for saving user data.
- Improve layout and branding.
